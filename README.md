# Singapore Rental Market Analysis

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Hello everyone, this is an assignment that I did for my Specialist Diploma in Data Science course from Singapore Polytechnic back in 2020.
The assignment requires us to define our own problem statement using datasets from <a href="https://data.gov.sg/">data.gov.sg</a>. 
The downloaded datasets can be found in the "Data" folder in the repository.     
</p>  

<p>
I highly recommend to look at the <b>slides(Rental market Market in Singapore PPT Deck.pdf)</b> in the repository for a detailed walkthrough of the data exploration, preperation and graph plotting process using python; the analysis and interpretation of the graphs are also included in the slides.   
</p>    

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></P>
<p>In this assignment, I gave a pseudo situation that a foreigner is moving to Singapore with his family for work. As such, he needs to investigate the rental market in Singapore to make a sound decision. </p>


<h1>Skillsets</h1>

Below are the skillsets that I have learnt through this assignment:


<ul>
    <li>Data exploration (descriptive statistic, identifying missing data)</li>
    <li>Data preperation for graph plotting</li>
    <li>Graph plotting using matplotlib (ploting, labelling, changing colours, axis etc) </li>
